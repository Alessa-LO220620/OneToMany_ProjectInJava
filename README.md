# OneToMany_ProjectInJava
This project is a small platform based on HR Services, that can be access by an user admin or a regular user. As Admin is possible to create new register, 
delete or update. Check the list of employees by position. Send the payroll of employee to to finance. As regular user is possible to check the payroll 
and print in pdf format, read the informations of absence.

Here you can check both files with front and backend scripts. I also used MVC arquitecture to write this project. 
To build the back-end were used spring framework, hibernate and the databases, mysql. 

Hope you enjoy it!
